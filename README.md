# DummyImage

Welcome to the **DummyImage** project! 🎉

## What is this?

This is a **test Docker image** for some teaching project. Yes, you heard it right! It's not meant to save the world  🐳

## What's inside?

- A `Makefile` with two magical spells:
  - `make restore`: Restores a Python virtual environment. 🪄
  - `make build-docker`: Builds a Docker image tagged as `test/helloworld`. 🚀

## How to use it?

1. Clone this repository. 🐒
2. Run `make restore` to set up your Python virtual environment. 🐍
3. Run `make build-docker` to build the Docker image. 🛠️
4. Enjoy your freshly baked Docker image! 🍞

## Why does this exist?

Because teaching is fun, and so is Docker! This project is here to help you learn the basics of Docker and Makefiles without breaking a sweat. 😎

## Disclaimer

This is a **dummy** project. Don't use it in production unless you enjoy living on the edge. 😉
